# Personal Expense Tracker

This is a console-based Personal Expense Tracker application implemented in Python. The tool is meant to help users manage their daily expenses effectively. It allows adding, viewing, summarizing, and searching expenses, while persistently storing the data for future access.

View Expenses: Displays all recorded expenses grouped by category.

Monthly Summary: Summarizes the total expenses per category for a particular month.

Search by Date Range: Retrieves the expenses for a specified date range.

Persistent Storage: It stores the expense data in a text file, `expenses.txt`, so it will be available even after closing the program.
